# MATSim Melbourne 2016 example scenario

To run an example MATSim scenario with the generated Melbourne 2016 population sample (see [../2016/README.md](../2016/README.md)), do the following:

1. Copy a suitable MATSim network file for Melbourne to `./net.xml.gz`
1. Generate a sample Melbourne population (see [../2016/README.md](../2016/README.md)) and copy the generated file to `./plans.xml`
1. Download and upzip the the [latest MATSim GUI](https://www.matsim.org/downloads/#gui) into the current directory
1. Start the MATSim GUI by double-clicking in the extracted JAR file, select the Configuration file `./config.xml`, and press **Start MATSim** to run the simulation. The MATSim output will by default be saved to `./output`.
